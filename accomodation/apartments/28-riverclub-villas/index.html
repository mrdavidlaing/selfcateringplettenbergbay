The Riverclub is gated village featuring lovely Victorian architecture 
set within spacious grounds and edged by the picturesque Piesang River.

It is a short walk from Central Beach – Plettenberg Bay’s main family beach.
The safe paved roads are especially appreciated by families with young
children, while all enjoy the swimming pool, tennis courts and squash courts on site.

We offer two or three bedroomed apartments with open plan living areas, fully 
equipped kitchens and patios with weber braais. Main bedrooms have queen size beds, 
second bedrooms either double or two single beds, 
and third bedrooms have twin singles, while the en suite bathroom offers a shower, 
and the main bathroom a bath.

The apartments have TV, DVD and DSTV – cards and decoders can be hired at a 
small extra charge.  Or simply bring your own decoder with card and plug into our fittings.

All linen and towels are provided – just bring beach towels.
