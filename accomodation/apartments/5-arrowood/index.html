The Arrowood complex, sitting high above the beach, offers stunning sea views.
It is very centrally placed, just up the hill from the beach and one block from 
the main street of the village. For views and convenience of position you cannot
beat Arrowood.  You can quite literally park your car and walk.

We offer two and three bedroomed apartments at Arrowood, sleeping four or six.
Each have queen beds in the main bedroom and doubles or singles in the other bedrooms.
There are two bathrooms, the main en suite bathroom has a shower and the
other bathroom a bath.  The open plan living areas offer fully equipped kitchens
and open onto patios with built in braai facilities, and that fabulous view.
11 Arrowood has an extra patio off the second bedroom.

The apartment complex is fully secure accessed by remote operated gate, and
also offers a sparkling swimming pool with toddler paddling pool, and full
laundry facilities.  Most apartments have extra security in the form of
trellidors, and dead bolts on sliding doors.

Apartments are fully equipped with all linen and towels (please bring beach towels),
and also offer TV, DVD players and DSTV.
You will need to bring your own card to access this facility,
or we can turn a card on for you at a small extra charge.

Due to the central location these apartments do suffer from some traffic noise
at busy times.  While  not usually a concern to our guests, if you are
sensitive to road noise perhaps view our Riverclub apartments as perfect alternatives.
